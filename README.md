<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using publicly available, county-level data on
social demographics, behaviors and health outcomes, we
explore select questions and correlations between factors.
The questions focus on the possible correlations between
socioeconomic factors, race/ethnicity, and health outcomes
for counties in which data was provided. Findings are
presented with correlational matrices and heatmaps of the
US counties for visualizations.</p>
<p>We attempt to answer questions like: Do areas
with higher negative economic factors have worse health
outcomes than areas with better economic factors? Is there
a correlation between educational attainment and health
outcomes? How does income inequality, childhood poverty,
affect health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol intake,
etc.? How do unemployment and lower insurance rates
affect mental health versus physical health outcomes? Do
areas with higher ratios of primary care physicians and
mental health providers have larger amounts of teen births?
As unemployment and educational attainment rise or fall,
do health outcomes change as a result? How does the
physical environment of an area (county) affect the health
outcomes of the population?</p>
